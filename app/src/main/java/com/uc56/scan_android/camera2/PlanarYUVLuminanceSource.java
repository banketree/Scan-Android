 * This object extends LuminanceSource around an array of YUV data returned from
 * the camera driver, with the option to crop to a rectangle within the full
 * data. This can be used to exclude superfluous pixels around the perimeter and
 * speed up decoding. It works for any pixel format where the Y channel is
 * planar and appears first, including YCbCr_420_SP and YCbCr_422_SP.
